<h1>Hangman</h1>
<p>Here, I provide a framework for the hangman game.  I am not sure how far we will get, but if you want to continue on your own, you can find a Trinket with the full game here:

<p><a href="https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/c5737537db">Hangman Code</a></a> 
</p>


<p>The first thing to think about is the structure of the program.  We are going to need these functions:
<li>A main function that runs everything</li>
<li>A function to pick a random word from a list of words</li>
<li>A function that keeps track of what letters we've picked and how much of the word has been figured out</li>
<li>A function that draws the hanged man - or maybe several functions, one for each body part</li>

<p>We are going to use a library called turtle to do the drawing. Here is an introduction to turtle:

<p>That should get us started.  Below is a link to a Trinket that I have started.  I have written some of the functions for you, since our time is so limited.  There are comments in the trinket itself to help guide you.</p>
