<h3>Welcome to the nerd summit 2015 Intro to Python session!</h3>

<h3>Plan for the session</h3>
<p>We will learn a few Python basics and learn to make a game like this Hangman Game.

<p>If you want to play, hit the RUN button then click in the window below the gallows to enter your guesses.

<p><iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/c5737537db?outputOnly=true" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>This code is hosted on Trinket.io .

<p> Here is a blank Trinket window.  If you type code and hit the run button, you will see the result of your code in the righthand window</p>

<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/90e6415dad" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Try typing: 

<br><code>print("hello world")</code>
<br>in the Trinket window and hit Run</p>


<p>To make our hangman game, we are going to use a library called turtle, which comes with Python.
  

<p>Drawing with turtle is pretty easy.  The idea is that the 'turtle' runs around in the 
window, leaving a trail behind it.  You, the programmer, can tell it what direction and how far to go.

<p>Try this in the Trinket window:
<code>
<br>import turtle # we need to import libraries we want to use
<br>my_turtle = turtle.Turtle() # this makes a new turtle called "my_turtle"
<br>my_turtle.forward(100)
<br>my_turtle.right(45)
<br>my_turtle.forward(50)
<br>my_turtle.left(90)
<br>my_turtle.forward(20)
</code>

<p>You can move the turtle without drawing if you first use this command

<code><br>my_turtle.penup()</code>

<p>then, to start drawing again, use:

<code><br>my_turtle.pendown()</code>

<p>There are other commands that can change the color and the thickness of the line, make circles, etc.

<p><p>Complete documentation can be found here:

<p>docs.python.org/2/library/turtle.html

<p>Try cutting and pasting the code above in this trinket...then change the numbers and rerun to see what the changes do.</p>





<h3>Additional resources</h3>

<p>If you want to continue learning, there are TONS of resources on the web.  Here are a few of my favorites:
<li><b></b>https://docs.python.org/3/</b> - official documentation.</li>
<li><b>codecombat.com</b> - learn to code while playing a game!</li>
<li><b>https://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python</b> - many tutorials, to take you as far as you want to go.</li>
<li><b>http://www.pythonchallenge.com/</b> - once you have some python under your belt, try these challenging riddles!  </li>
