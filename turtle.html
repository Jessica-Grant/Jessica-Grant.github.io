<h3>Turtle</h3>
<p>To make our hangman game, we are going to use a library called turtle, which comes with Python.
  

<p>Drawing with turtle is pretty easy.  The idea is that the 'turtle' runs around in the 
window, leaving a trail behind it.  You, the programmer, can tell it what direction and how far to go.

<p>Try this in the Trinket window:
<code>
<br>import turtle # we need to import libraries we want to use
<br>my_turtle = turtle.Turtle() # this makes a new turtle called "my_turtle"
<br>my_turtle.forward(100)
<br>my_turtle.right(45)
<br>my_turtle.forward(50)
<br>my_turtle.left(90)
<br>my_turtle.forward(20)
</code>

<p>You can move the turtle without drawing if you first use this command

<code><br>my_turtle.penup()</code>

<p>then, to start drawing again, use:

<code><br>my_turtle.pendown()</code>

<p>There are other commands that can change the color and the thickness of the line, make circles, etc.

<p>Try adding:</p>
<code>my_turtle.color("red")</code>
<p>at the beginning and run it again</p>
<p><p>Complete documentation for <b>turtle</b> can be found here:

<p>docs.python.org/2/library/turtle.html

<p>Try cutting and pasting the code above in this trinket...then change the numbers and rerun to see what the changes do.</p>
