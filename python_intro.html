<h1>Intro</h1>
<p>We are going to start by just typing some basic Python commands into the interpreter window.  We are going to use an online Python environment called Trinket.
<p>Trinkets can be embedded into web pages, like this one.  If you want to make your own Trinkets later, the web page is here:

<p>https://trinket.io</p>

<p>for now, let's use the one embedded here.</p>
<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/90e6415dad" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Type some of these commands - it doesn't matter if you understand everything, it is just to get used to typing python.  After typing each command, hit the RUN button
<p><code>print "hello world"</code>
<p>
<p><code>x = 10 + 5
<p>print x</p></code>

<p>
<p><code>my_name = ""</code> (type your name between the quotation marks)
<p><code>print my_name</code>
<p>
  
  
<p>One of the most important features of any programming language is its ability to manipulate variables. A variable is just a name that refers to a value; you can think of a variable as a box that stores a piece of data.
<p>In Python, the basic data types are strings and numbers. There are two types of numbers: integers (both positive and negative) and floats (fractional numbers with a decimal point). 
<p>Above, you used the varaiable named <b>x</b> to store the value 15 and the variable <b>my_name</b> to store a string</p></p>


<h1>Math</h1>
Python can be used like a calculator, and "knows" a lot of math.  Look at the code in the Trinket window below.  Hit the RUN button and see what happens.
<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/caab4f405d" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
One of the really great things about Python, though, is that  there are many libraries that can be imported and used.  
Libraries are bits of code that someone else has written that we can use.  If you ever want to do somethign in Python, I suggest 
searching for libraries that already do what you want to do!

<p>We are going to want to pick a random number, and there is a library called random that we can use.  To use a library, you first have to import it.</p>
<p>Delete the code in the trinket above and then type:

<p><code>import random</code></p>

<p></p>into the Trinket window.

Now we can use a function in the random library called <code>randrange</code>.  <code>randrange</code> takes a number as input, and returns a random number between zero and the number you have given it.

Type:
<p><code>print random.randrange(100)</code>

<p>in your Trinket, and hit run a few times.  What happens?

<h1>Strings</h1>
Python thinks of words as strings made up of characters.  They are defined with quotation marks, like these:

<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/d6c3900d52" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Notice that the spaces are considered characters, too</p>
<p>If you contniue in Python, you will see that there are lots of things you can do with strings.  One feature we will use to make our hangman game, is indexing.
<p>Each position in the string has an index, starting with zero.</p>

In the Trinket above, type <br>

<code><p>
print my_string[0] # this is the first character in the string<br>
print my_string[1:8] # this is a 'slice' of the string, from the second character ([1]) to just before but not including the eighth character<br>
print my_string[1:8:2] # this is a 'slice' of the string, as above, but taking every second character<br>
print my_string[-1] # negative indices start from the end, so -1 is the last character<br>
</code>

<p>We can also add strings or pices of strings together.  Try this<br>

<code>
new_string = my_string[:7] + ' not ' + my_string[8:]<br>
print new_string<br>
</code>



<h1>Loops</h1>
There are lots of ways we can tell computers what to do. For Loops are a common way of telling a computer to do something for each item in a list. In Python that will look like this:

<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/6c9bbe0c42" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
Hit RUN and see what happens.

<p>We can use loops to keep track of our hangman game - run the code in this Trinket and see what happens.</p>

<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/5d1595a5ba" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>You can also use loops if you want to keep doing something until something else happens.  For this you can use a <code>while</code>  loop </p>

<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/c6698d0b29" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Here, as long as x is less than 15, the loop will keep printing x.  Once x equals 15, we exit the loop and print "Done!!"

<h1>Lists</h1>
<p>Lists are another way to store data.  They are stored inside square brackets, like this:
<code>['this','is',1,'list']</code>






<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/bc0bc62827" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Just like with strings, you can use the index (position number) of an item in your list.  Try adding this to the Trinket:

<code>
print my_list[0]<br>
print my_list[2]
</code>

<p>We will use a list to keep track of the incorrect letters that have already been chosen.

<h1>Functions</h1>
<p>The last thing we need to know is how to write a function</p>
<p>Functions are a way to write a piece of code that you can use over and over again, whenever you want to.  You can give the function input variables and your function can return output.
<p>To define a function you use the word <b>def</b>:</p>

<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/336603e732" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Hit RUN.  What happens?

<p>When you define a function, it gets ready to do something but it doesn't do it yet.  You need to call the function, like this:

my_function("This is my function")
my_function("My function is great!")

<p>Cut and paste those function calls into the Trinket window and hit RUN again</p>
