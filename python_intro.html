<h1>Intro</h1>
<p>We are going to start by just typing some basic Python commands into the interpreter window.  We are going to use an online Python environment called Trinket.
<p>Trinkets can be embedded into web pages, like this one.  If you want to make your own Trinkets later, the web page is here:

<p>https://trinket.io</p>

<p>for now, let's use the one embedded here.</p>
<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/90e6415dad" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Type some of these commands - it doesn't matter if you understand everything, it is just to get used to typing python.  After typing each command, hit the RUN button
<p><code>print "hello world"</code>
<p>
<p><code>print 10 + 5</code>
<p>
<p><code>my_name = ""</code> (type your name between the quotation marks)
<p><code>print my_name</code>
<p>
<h1>Math</h1>
Python can be used like a calculator, and "knows" a lot of math.  Look at the code in the Trinket window below.  Hit the RUN button and see what happens.

One of the really great things about Python, though, is that  there are many libraries that can be imported and used.  
Libraries are bits of code that someone else has written that we can use.  If you ever want to do somethign in Python, I suggest 
searching for libraries that already do what you want to do!

<p>We are going to want to pick a random number, and there is a library called random that we can use.  To use a library, you first have to import it.</p>
<p>Delete the code in the trinket above and then type:

<p><code>import random</code></p>

<p></p>into the Trinket window.

Now we can use a function in the random library called <code>randrange</code>.  <code>randrange</code> takes a number as input, and returns a random number between zero and the number you have given it.

Type:
<p><code>print random.randrange(100)</code>

<p>in your Trinket, and hit run a few times.  What happens?

<h1>Strings and Lists</h1>
Python thinks of words as strings made up of characters.  They are defined with quotation marks, like these:

<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/d6c3900d52" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Notice that the spaces are considered characters, too</p>
<p>There are lots of things you can do with strings.  You can add two strings together - try typing this in the Trinket</p>

<code><p>str1 = 'Hello'
<p>str2 = ' ' 
<p>str3 = 'Goodbye'
<p>print str1
<p>print str2
<p>print str3
<p>print str1 + str2 + str3</code>

<p>And hit RUN</p>

<h1>Loops</h1>
There are lots of ways we can tell computers what to do. For Loops are a common way of telling a computer to do something for each item in a list. In Python that will look like this:
